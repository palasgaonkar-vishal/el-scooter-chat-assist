## Task 002 - Completed Features ✅

### ✅ Database Schema Design
- **Complete table structure**: 7 main tables (profiles, faqs, chat_conversations, orders, escalated_queries, analytics, system_settings)
- **Custom PostgreSQL types**: user_role, escalation_priority, escalation_status, order_status, scooter_model, faq_category
- **Proper relationships**: Foreign keys with cascading deletes where appropriate
- **Data integrity**: Unique constraints, default values, and proper nullability

### ✅ Text Similarity & Search Infrastructure
- **pg_trgm extension**: Enabled for trigram-based text similarity
- **Full-text search**: GIN indexes on FAQ questions and answers
- **Custom similarity function**: `calculate_text_similarity()` combining trigram similarity and TF-IDF ranking
- **Performance indexes**: Strategic indexing for all major query patterns

### ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- **Comprehensive policies**: Secure access control for all tables
- **Role-based access**: Admin vs customer permissions properly segregated
- **User isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **System operations**: Analytics and system functions have appropriate permissions

### ✅ Database Functions & Automation
- **Auto profile creation**: Trigger-based user profile creation from auth.users
- **Data retention**: Automated cleanup for expired chat conversations
- **Timestamp management**: Auto-updating timestamp triggers
- **Text similarity**: Advanced similarity calculation for FAQ matching

### ✅ Sample Data & Configuration
- **15 comprehensive FAQs**: Covering all major categories (charging, service, range, orders, cost, license, warranty)
- **System settings**: Default configuration for thresholds and limits
- **Realistic data**: FAQ view counts, ratings, and engagement metrics
- **Multi-model support**: FAQ data tagged for different Ather scooter models

### ✅ Developer Experience & Utilities
- **Type-safe database layer**: Complete TypeScript integration with Supabase types
- **Database utility functions**: Centralized operations in `src/lib/database.ts`
- **React Query hooks**: Custom hooks for all major database operations in `src/hooks/useDatabase.ts`
- **Error handling**: Proper error logging and user feedback
- **Performance optimization**: Query caching and stale-time configuration

### ✅ Industry Standards Implemented
- **Security first**: Comprehensive RLS policies prevent data leaks
- **Performance optimized**: Strategic indexing and query patterns
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript integration with database schema
- **Maintainable code**: Clean separation of concerns and reusable utilities
- **Monitoring ready**: Analytics table structure for tracking usage patterns
- **Scalable architecture**: Designed to handle growth in users and data

## Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Tasks 001-002**: ✅ Both Complete - Ready for Task 003 (Authentication System)
2. **Task 003**: Required for all user-facing features (database access depends on authentication)
3. **Tasks 005-006**: Core functionality for customer experience
4. **Task 007**: Depends on 005-006 for escalation logic
5. **Tasks 008-010**: Can be developed in parallel after authentication
6. **Task 011**: Depends on core functionality (005-006)
7. **Task 012**: Final task requiring all others

## Key Milestones

- Mobile optimization challenges
- Testing timeline constraints

## Success Criteria
- [x] All functional requirements for routing implemented ✅
- [x] Mobile-first design fully responsive ✅
- [x] Navigation works seamlessly between customer and admin flows ✅
- [x] Route structure supports future authentication integration ✅
- [x] Complete database schema with proper relationships ✅
- [x] Sample data available for testing ✅
- [x] Security policies properly configured ✅
- [x] Text similarity functions operational ✅
- [ ] All functional requirements (FR001-FR020) implemented
- [ ] All non-functional requirements (NFR001-NFR008) met
- [ ] 95% authentication success rate
- [ ] 80% FAQ matching accuracy

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements
- **FAQ Similarity Scoring**: Current implementation uses mock scores; needs integration with the `calculate_text_similarity` function
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase real-time subscriptions can be added for live chat and analytics
- **File Upload**: Storage bucket setup needed for chat file uploads
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add query performance tracking in analytics
- **Internationalization**: Database schema supports multi-language expansion

## Database Performance Metrics
- **Total Tables**: 7 (profiles, faqs, chat_conversations, orders, escalated_queries, analytics, system_settings)
- **Custom Functions**: 4 (similarity calculation, user creation, chat cleanup, timestamp updates)
- **Indexes Created**: 12 strategic indexes for query optimization
- **RLS Policies**: 15 comprehensive security policies
- **Sample Data**: 15 FAQs with realistic engagement metrics

## Notes
- **Tasks 001-002** completed successfully with all acceptance criteria met
- Database schema follows PostgreSQL best practices with proper normalization
- RLS policies ensure data security without blocking legitimate access
- Utility functions provide clean abstraction over database operations
- React Query integration enables optimal caching and state management
- Type-safe database operations prevent runtime errors
- Sample data enables immediate testing of search and matching functionality
- Performance indexes support expected query patterns for 100+ daily active users
- **Ready to proceed with Task 003 (Authentication System)**

## Status Legend
- **Not Started**: Task not yet begun
- **In Progress**: Task currently being worked on
- **Review**: Task completed, awaiting review/testing
- **Complete**: Task fully completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Tasks 001-002**: Must be completed first (foundation)
2. **Task 003**: Required for all user-facing features
3. **Tasks 005-006**: Core functionality for customer experience
4. **Task 007**: Depends on 005-006 for escalation logic
5. **Tasks 008-010**: Can be developed in parallel after authentication
6. **Task 011**: Depends on core functionality (005-006)
7. **Task 012**: Final task requiring all others

## Key Milestones
- [ ] **Week 1 Day 1-2**: Foundation (Tasks 001-003)
- [ ] **Week 1 Day 3-4**: Core Features (Tasks 004-007)
- [ ] **Week 1 Day 5-6**: Admin Features (Tasks 008-010)
- [ ] **Week 1 Day 7**: Optimization & Testing (Tasks 011-012)

## Risk Factors
- Supabase integration complexity
- Text similarity algorithm performance
- Mobile optimization challenges
- Testing timeline constraints

## Success Criteria
